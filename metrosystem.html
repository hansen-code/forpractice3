      <h1>how metro system works in porto</h1>

      <img src="mao.jpg" width="50%">
      when you want to get into metro, you should do <strong>"validation"</strong>.
      <br>you can do validation by tagging your "andante card"
      <br>once you buy andante card, you should charge "title" in your card.
      <br>title consists of z1 to z10. the higher number of title andante card have the more expensive the title is.
      <br>so if you arent stupid you should charge minimum number as possible as you can do.
      <br>what title you should charge depends on distance from center of porto.
      <br>for example if you want to go from airport to center of porto, you need to charge z4 because you have to cross 4 zones
